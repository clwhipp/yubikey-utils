# Set to the prompt that appears when the LUKS password is needed to decrypt
# the volume protected with a Yubikey
WELCOME_TEXT="Please insert Yubikey and press enter or enter a valid passphrase"

# Set this to a previously-enrolled challenge password if you want to use 1FA 
# (one-factor authentication), which checks for the paired Yubikey's presence.
# This will suppress the interactive prompt for the password during boot time.
# If the Yubikey is not presetnt at boot time, then the password prompt 
# is displayed and will unlock if one of the LUKS slots is using that as 
# a normal password. This is weaker than 2-factor authentication, but allows 
# for an unattended boot so long as the Yubikey is present.
# Leave this empty (or unset), if you want to do 2FA -- i.e. being asked for the password during boot time.
# YUBIKEY_CHALLENGE="password"

# Set to "1" if you want to enable the extended challenge-response capability.
# The default challenge-response will transmit the password over the USB
# connection to the yubikey. This opens the password up to being sniffed on
# it's way to yubikey. The response from yubikey is also susceptible to sniffing
# on its way to the system. The extended mode derives a challenge from the password
# using a one-way digest function. This removes the risk of sniffing all potential
# inputs to the LUKS password.
EXTENDED_CHALLENGE=1
